# Contributing

In general, Earl Grey is a one-person project. The best way to contribute to the
project is by reporting issues, rather than submitting changes directly.  It is
unlikely that large changes to the color scheme itself will be accepted.

If you have a problem with a particular implementation, or you would like to
discuss a new implementation of the Earl Grey theme, please open an issue first
before opening a pull request.
